**Summary**

This [PRFC ](https://github.com/exmosis/prfc-0-prfcs/blob/master/prfc-0.md) collates and sets out thoughts on web design according to an Empty Tech mindset - that is, a use of technology designed so that the technology itself gets out of the way as much as possible, leaving the user to fill the space created by the tools.

Empty Tech design is not an isolated view, but draws on multiple perspectives, blah blah blah.

**Background**

This PRFC primarily comes about from attempting to re-think the [TaoPunk website](https://www.taopunk.uk/). Aside from deciding what content it should contain, it is also equally important to set out how it should appear.

**Aims**

* Set out some vaguely-clear guidance, principles and values which any design for the site should be able to measure itself against

**Spec**

* **1. Those who know do not speak:** Content, especially text, should be minimal. What content there is should be _focused_, that is it should have a purpose, and the purpose should be clear and understood, at least by the author. Intent may or may not be consciously adhered to by the end user.

* **2. Cut doors and windows for a room; it is the holes which make it useful:** Blank space is to be encouraged, and should be the preferred way for the eye to navigate the content. Content should be carefully weighted, and Edward Tufte's idea of [Data-to-ink ratio](https://infovis-wiki.net/wiki/Data-Ink_Ratio) should be borne in mind.

* **3. The five colours blind the eye:** Designs should not seek to be 'impressive', yet they will feel polished and natural when finished. Understatement should lead to an inherent sense of relaxation. Subtlety and no surprises.
